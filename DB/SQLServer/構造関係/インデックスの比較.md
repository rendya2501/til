# インデックスの比較

2つのデータベースを比較して、インデックスで差分があるものを抜き出したい。

---

## データベースのインデックス一覧を取得する

[このサイト](https://sql55.com/query/sql-server-list-all-indexes.php)で紹介されている例。  
実行したデータベースのインデックス情報を出力するクエリとなる。  

``` sql
SELECT
    S.name AS SchemaName,
    O.name AS ObjectName,
    I.name AS IndexName,
    I.type_desc AS IndexTypeDesc,
    I.is_primary_key AS IsPrimaryKey,
    I.is_unique AS IsUnique,
    I.is_disabled AS IsDisabled
FROM
    sys.indexes AS I
       INNER JOIN sys.objects AS O
          ON I.object_id = O.object_id
       INNER JOIN sys.schemas AS S
          ON O.schema_id = S.schema_id
WHERE
    I.index_id > 0
    AND O.is_ms_shipped = 0
ORDER BY 
    S.name,
    O.name,
    I.name;
```

---

## Diff方式

単純に差分を取得しただけ

``` sql

       INNER JOIN dst.sys.schemas AS S

    AND O.is_ms_shipped = 0
ORDER BY

```

``` sql

## FULL OUTER JOIN 方式

``` sql
SELECT
